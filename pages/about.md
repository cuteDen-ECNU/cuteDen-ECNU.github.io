Hi! I'm Wenjing. 

I am a master student in [TISE](https://lab301.cn/) lab at ECNU. 

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Geguang Pu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=niQAGcQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Chengyu Zhang](https://chengyuzhang.com/).

I used to be a [psyer](https://psy.ecnu.edu.cn/) and now I am a coder. ðŸ¥³
Coding gives me a sense of accomplishment.

My research interests are in:

- Software Engineering 

- Programming Languages 

- Formal Methods 

Welcome to contact me!
