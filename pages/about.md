I am doing an internship at [NUS Test Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/) for half a year.

I am a master student supervised by [Prof. Geguang Pu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=niQAGcQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Chengyu Zhang](https://chengyuzhang.com/) at [Trusted Intelligent Software Engineering Lab at East China Normal University](https://lab301.cn/).

I received B.S. degree from the [School of Psychology and Cognitive Science](https://psy.ecnu.edu.cn/) at [East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/) in 2021.
