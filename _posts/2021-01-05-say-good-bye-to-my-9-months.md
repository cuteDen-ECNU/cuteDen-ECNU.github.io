The competition for the Chinese Graduate Entrance Examination (Postgraduate Entrance Examination in China) has been extremely fierce.

In 2021, only tens of thousands are successfully admitted among 3.77 million candidates. 

I prepared for this exam for 9 months, and even if I didn't succeed, I wouldn't have any regrets.

## Some record for this exam

(For reference purposes only, available to fellow students who have undergone a similar process of changing majors.)
